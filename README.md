Balanced Trees described in these papers:

## Usage

This will be fleshed out when the library is more complete, but the
current intention is to make the usage identical to the
[`core.rrb-vector`](https://github.com/clojure/core.rrb-vector)
library, but with better performance in terms of constant factors.
